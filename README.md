# Sorting
Selection Sort : The selection sort algorithm is based on the idea of finding the maximum and minimum  element in the sorted array and then putting them in the correct position.

                          Time Complexity : O(n^2);
                         The Selection sort not make more than O(n) swap.
			 
Bubble Sort : Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeated comparison and the swapping them if they exists in the wrong order.

                          Time Complexity : O(n2) for both worst and average  case  because entire array is iterated for every element.
			  
Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is based on the idea  that one element is consumed from the input element to find its correct position i.e. position in the Sorted array .

                          Time complexity : O(n^2)
			  
	Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Merge Sort : Merge Sort is divide and conquer algorithm is basically based on the idea of breaking down the  list into several sub-lists until each sub list consist of one element  which then we merge in the manner to get sorted list.

			Time complexity : 0(nlogn)  in all the cases  worst , average and best.
